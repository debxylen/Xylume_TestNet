<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Network Architecture</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
    Xylume TestNet uses a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture where nodes communicate via socket-based
    connections. Every node operates both as a sender and a receiver — maintaining open threads for bidirectional
    communication with its peers. There is no centralized coordinator or leader; all nodes function autonomously,
    forming a dynamic mesh across the network.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
    New nodes discover and connect to the network using an automatically maintained list of healthy nodes <b>[WIP]</b>.
    This ensures they only interact with responsive, well-performing peers — avoiding downtime or lag from faulty nodes.
    The decentralized structure is preserved, but the quality of connectivity is optimized.

        <p class="text-gray-400">
          A curated list of healthy nodes is planned to simplify peer discovery. In the future, new nodes will connect
          to all active peers from this list and self-register for visibility. Until then, node connectivity will
          require manual configuration and connecting to known peers.

    Once connected, nodes receive mined transactions via broadcasts. Each node revalidates the transaction
    independently, checking the juice availability and transaction structure. If the transaction is valid, it is added
    to the node’s local DAG. The sender adds it regardless of peer feedback — ensuring self-validation remains the
    ultimate authority.

        <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">No Forced Consensus</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-400">
          A node does not follow the majority. If a node's validation logic accepts a transaction, it adds it to its DAG
          — even if every peer disagrees. This protects against Sybil attacks and centralization by rejecting social
          consensus in favor of protocol logic.

  <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
    While this may lead to temporary desynchronization with other nodes, the design assumes that honest nodes using the
    correct validation logic will naturally converge over time. Malicious or modified nodes will eventually fall out of
    sync and be ignored.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-400">
    There is no voting, no leader election, and no majority rule. The network remains secure, decentralized, and
    scalable — driven by autonomous validation and trustless peer communication.
