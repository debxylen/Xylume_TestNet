<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Core Architecture & Transaction Flow</h1>

<p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">
  Xylume TestNet uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure to process and validate transactions in a parallel,
  high-performance manner. Instead of using blocks like traditional blockchains, transactions in Xylume are connected in
  a flowing graph, where each transaction links to its parent(s), forming a scalable and efficient validation network.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</h2>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  Traditional blockchains follow a linear chain structure, where transactions are grouped into blocks and appended one
  after another. This creates bottlenecks in performance and transaction speed. In contrast, Xylume TestNet leverages a
  DAG model, allowing multiple transactions to be validated and added simultaneously, without waiting for block
  production.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">
  In a DAG, each transaction points to one or more previous transactions. This parallel structure removes the dependency
  on block intervals and increases the network's ability to scale, making it ideal for high-throughput environments.

      <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">No Forks. No Reorgs.</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-400">
        There’s no “longest chain” to fight over. Transactions in Xylume reference valid parents directly, making
        classic reorgs and forks practically impossible. Nodes follow the rules — not the crowd.
      </p>

  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Parent-Child Transaction Model</h2>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  Each transaction in Xylume acts as both a child and a potential parent. Child transactions reference the unspent
  outputs of their parent transactions — a mechanism that ensures secure and traceable value transfer. This linking of
  transactions forms a hierarchical structure within the DAG, enhancing transaction integrity by forming a series of
  validated transactions in the graph.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">
  This parent-child model not only enables parallel processing but also helps in eliminating redundant validations. Once
  a parent transaction is validated and part of the DAG, its children can be validated with minimal checks,
  significantly improving propagation speed and performance across the network.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Juice System</h2>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  The core of Xylume’s validation logic revolves around the concept of “juice.” Juice refers to the unspent output of a
  transaction, similar to the UTXO model used in Bitcoin. A child transaction must use the juice from its parent to be
  considered valid. This ensures a provable and secure flow of value, as every transaction can be traced back through
  its lineage of parents.

      <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">No voting. No forks. Just rule-based elimination.</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-400">
        Each node in Xylume independently validates transactions and assumes its own logic is correct. If a transaction
        passes validation, it is accepted — regardless of majority opinion. Honest nodes naturally align; faulty or
        malicious ones drift out of sync and get ignored. No strict consensus mechanism is required: just rule-based
        validation and deterministic resolution.
      </p>

</div>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Proof of Unspent Transaction eXploration (PoUTX)</h2>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  Xylume uses Proof of Unspent Transaction eXploration (PoUTX) as its core validation and mining mechanism. Miners
  explore the DAG to locate valid parent transactions with unspent outputs referred to as <strong>juice</strong>. They
  then submit the parent hashes and the child transaction’s hash to a node for verification.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  The receiving node independently re-validates the submission by checking signatures, juice availability, and
  correctness. Upon successful 'mining', the transaction is added to the DAG. This process ensures that no
  double-spending occurs and that the resulting transaction graph reflects a secure, traceable flow of value.
  As a result, the series of validated transactions naturally ensures that only valid transactions are included in the
  DAG.

    <div>
      <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Efficiency Bonus</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-400">Since each transaction only depends on its direct parent(s), PoUTX enables a lightweight
        state dependency system that eliminates the need to reference global state — making validation faster, more
        efficient, and resilient against structural attacks.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Summary</h2>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  Together, the DAG structure, parent-child model, juice system, and PoUTX validation form the core of Xylume TestNet’s
  architecture. It enables fast, parallel transaction processing, high scalability, hardware efficiency, integrity, and
  secure value transfer — all without relying on blocks or global state.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-400">
  While currently running as a TestNet, it reflects the intended core logic and architecture of Xylume’s eventual
  mainnet. The system is built to support secure, performant decentralized applications, transactions and much more
  without relying on slow, traditional blockchains or centralized design patterns.
