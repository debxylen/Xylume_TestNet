<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Security & Integrity</h2>

<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  Xylume TestNet is built with security and data integrity at its core. It uses robust cryptographic systems, structural
  transaction validation, and decentralized enforcement to ensure that every transaction is legitimate, verifiable, and
  tamper-proof — all without relying on traditional consensus algorithms.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Cryptographic Security</h3>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  Every transaction on Xylume is digitally signed using the sender’s private key, guaranteeing authenticity and
  non-repudiation. PoUTX ensures no double-spending can occur by requiring proof of unspent outputs ("juice") before any
  new transaction is accepted.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">
  To further enhance speed and efficiency, Xylume uses <code>BLAKE2b</code> as its primary hashing algorithm — offering
  strong cryptographic guarantees and outperforming traditional hashes like SHA-256 in terms of performance and
  computational cost.

      <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Why BLAKE2b?</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-400">
        BLAKE2b is faster than SHA-2, more secure than MD5, and uses less power — making it ideal for high-throughput
        systems like Xylume.

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Resistance to Attacks</h3>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
  Xylume TestNet is inherently resistant to common blockchain attack vectors like 51% attacks, Sybil attacks, and
  double-spending. The core architecture makes these exploits ineffective by design.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-400 space-y-2 mb-6">
  <li><strong>DAG-Based Structure</strong> — With no chain or longest-chain rule, there's nothing to reorganize.
    Transactions validate past states, not a sequential block list.</li>
  <li><strong>Parent-Child Validation</strong> — Invalid transactions will not be referenced by honest nodes, preventing
    malicious forks or conflicting transactions from being accepted.</li>
  <li><strong>Juice Rule</strong> — Prevents double-spending by enforcing a strict unspent output requirement. If juice
    is already consumed, the transaction fails.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Gas Model</strong> — Inspired by EIP-1559, the gas fee scales with network usage, disincentivizing
    spam or denial-of-service attempts.</li>
  <li><strong>Peer Skepticism</strong> — Nodes rely on verified transaction history. A peer must reference valid prior
    transactions in the DAG to get a transaction accepted across other nodes in the network, making Xylume fundamentally
    immune to Sybil-based consensus manipulation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-gray-400">
  These combined strategies allow Xylume to deliver uncompromising transactional integrity, powerful spam resistance,
  and robust defense against malicious actors — even under high network load or adversarial conditions.
