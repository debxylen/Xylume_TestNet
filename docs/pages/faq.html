  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Is Xylume a blockchain?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400">
    Xylume is <strong>not</strong> a blockchain. However, it’s a functioning decentralized ledger based on a
    <strong>DAG</strong> with full support for validation, P2P networking, transaction flow, tokens, contracts, mining
    and everything — just not on mainnet yet. Tokens have no monetary value, but everything else works for real.

<div class="mb-6">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I use Ethereum tools and wallets like ethers.js or MetaMask?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400">
    Yep. Xylume TestNet is EVM-compatible, so you can connect with MetaMask, WalletConnect, or any EVM-compatible
    wallet. Ethereum libraries and tools such as ethers and web3 are also compatible with Xylume.
  </p>

<div class="mb-6">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Are the test tokens worth anything?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400">
    Nope. TestNet tokens (XYL) are for testing, playing around, development and experimentation only. They hold no real
    value and cannot be traded for money.

<div class="mb-6">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I deploy smart contracts?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400">
    Absolutely. Xylume supports most of the EVM stack. You can deploy and interact with contracts just like you would on
    Ethereum or any EVM-based chain.

        <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Smart contracts are temporarily disabled</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-400">
          The contract logic is currently under revision and testing. It’ll be re-enabled soon with improvements and
          stability fixes.
          <b>Native core contracts, reserve addresses, and tokens deployed via the Native Token Handler remain
            unaffected.</b>

<div class="mb-6">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How do I get test tokens?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400">
    Use our faucet — just enter your wallet address and you’ll get some XYL to play with. Faucet link is in the Getting
    Started section.

<div class="mb-6">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I run a node or mine?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400">
    Yes. You can run your own node and even mine transactions using the official miner. Links to guides and tools are
    available throughout the docs.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="mb-6">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Will this become a mainnet?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-400">
    That's the goal. Xylume TestNet is a full simulation of how the mainnet would work. Once liquidity and deployment
    resources are ready, the mainnet will follow — with possible upgrades and a fresh genesis.
