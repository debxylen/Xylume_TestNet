# Xylume TestNet

**Xylume TestNet is a next-gen decentralized Layer 1 platform and protocol optimized for high throughput, scalability, and performance, enabling low-cost, sub-second transactions with strong security and efficiency.**  

Powered by a UTXO-based DAG architecture with a parent-child transaction model, EVM compatibility, parallel mining support, and a strict FIFO execution funnel â€” enabling high concurrency without sacrificing determinism, security or integrity.  

---

## Features

- DAG-based transaction structure (not linear blocks)
- Structured UTXO-based architecture with parent-child linkage, unlike state model systems like Ethereum
- EVM-compatibility with contracts, JSON-RPC and methods, and Ethereumâ€™s core standards and infrastructure
- Strict yet lightning-fast FIFO execution via a "funnel" system â€” enabling sequential logic without bottlenecks, and parallel mining without breaking order
- Ultra-fast transaction processing with sub-second finality and minimal gas fees
- Lightweight, fair, and dynamic gas model â€” responsive to real-time transaction load and complexity
- Decentralized by design, with open P2P node support and mining
- Real-time transaction streaming via public WebSocket endpoint
- No global consensus â€” Sybil-resistance via self-trusting, local-first validation
- Plug-and-play ecosystem: explorer, miner, faucet, docs and more
